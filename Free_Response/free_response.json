We could have used the fact from the notes that tells us how the line integrals for the two directions related to allow us to use the equation of the line if we'd wanted to. We decided to do it this way just for the practice of dealing with the vector form for the line segment and it's not all that difficult to deal with the result and the limits are \u201cnicer\u201d.\n\nNote as well that for $C_3$ we could have solved for the equation of the line and used that because the direction is in the increasing x direction.

Also, mucus buildup from pancreatic cells blocks the secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes and results in incomplete digestion and diarrhea. Life expectancy is 30 to 40 years for individuals who inherit two copies of the autosomal recessive trait.\n\nThe disorder is caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), an ATP-activated ion channel protein. Binding of ATP to CFTR triggers the opening of a channel that allows Cl- to passively flow across the plasma membrane. In epithelial lung cells, the channel enables the movement of Cl- out of the cell, though in other cell types, the channel can be structured so as to promote Cl- into the cell.\n\nIn normal individuals, epinephrine initiates a signal transduction pathway by binding to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) on the plasma membrane of epithelial lung cells. The GPCR then activates an exchange of a GTP for a GDP on a nearby G protein. This G protein, now activated with the GTP, binds to the GPCR. This allows the release of a G subunit (G\u03b1) that binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP activates a protein kinase (PKA). PKA enables two ATP molecules to bind to the CFTR protein, triggering the opening of a gated channel in the CFTR and allowing for the passive passage of Cl- out of the cell.\n\nThe movement of Cl- into the extracellular fluid creates an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane that induces water to move out of the cell. A Na+/K+ pump, also activated by PKA and ATP, helps regulate the electrochemical gradient to maintain an appropriate surface liquid on the epithelial cells.  (Answer is a single word.)",

Adenosine is a ligand that binds to a G protein-coupled receptor on brain cells, activating a G protein by replacing its bound GDP with a GTP. A subunit of the G protein then binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase (AC), a membrane-bound effector protein. Adenylyl cyclase then catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger. The cellular response to cAMP varies widely in different types of cells. In brain cells and other cells of the central nervous system, cAMP activates a protein kinase (PKA), which slows brain activity and causes drowsiness. Normally, cAMP concentrations in the cell are kept low by the enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), converting cAMP to regular AMP (not cyclic). But high levels of cAMP can be attained during periods of mental fatigue or other kinds of stress.Does GTP bound to a subunit of the G protein activates adenylyl cyclase (AC)? (Yes of No)",

Position C is known to have a large number of charged residues.\nA mutation is discovered in the gene for ARKKKK60491 that converts positively charged lysine residue into negatively charged glutamic acid residue. This single change directly impacts the location where the substrate to ARKKKK60491 attaches during catalysis. Which position is likely affected by this change? \nI. Position A\n\nII. Position B\n\nIII. Position C\n (Answer is a single letter.)",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "\\answer{I}.The question states that the change affects the place where the substrate binds, which is defined as the active site. Position A is identified as the active site.",

            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "\\answer{No}. The protein is known to be a homodimer, so it must have two polypeptides in it. Each polypeptide has one N-terminus, so this dimer protein would have two. They would not occur at the active site, so Position A should not be in the answer.",

            "Question": "An experiment is performed to evaluate the amount of DNA present during a complete cell cycle. All of the cells were synced prior to the start of the experiment. During the experiment, a fluorescent chemical was applied to cells, which would fluoresce only when bound to DNA. The results of the experiment are shown above. Differences in cell appearance by microscopy or changes in detected DNA were determined to be phases of the cell cycle and are labeled with the letters A-D.\nApproximately how long does S phase take to occur in these cells?  (Final Answer is a value)",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "\\answer{30}. The synthesis, or S phase, of the cell cycle represents the step in which the genetic material is duplicated. The only phase labeled in the experiment that represents an increase is phase B. Based on the time scale on the x-axis, this phase lasts approximately 30 minutes.",

The duration of the cell cycle varies from one species to another and from one cell type to another. The G1 phase varies the most. For example, embryonic cells can pass through the G1 phase so quickly that it hardly exists, whereas neurons are arrested in the cell cycle and do not divide.

(Final Answer is a value)",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "\\answer{0.5}. Because the woman is a carrier, she must have one normal copy of the X chromosome and one diseased copy. Since the boy will receive an X chromosome from his mother, there is a 50 percent chance that he will receive a diseased copy. Because he doesn't have a second X chromosome, he must have the disease if he receives the diseased X chromosome.",
