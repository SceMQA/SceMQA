The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us how to find the derivative of an integral: $\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{c}^{x} f(t) , dt = f(x)$, where $c$ is a constant. Thus, $g'(x) = f(x)$. The graph of $f$ is zero at $x = 0$, $x = 2$, and $x = 4$. We can eliminate $x = 0$ because we are looking for a positive value of $x$. Next, notice that $f$ is negative to the left of $x = 4$ and positive to the right of $x = 4$. Thus, $g(x)$ has a minimum at $x = 4$.\n\nWe also could have found the answer geometrically.

For example, when $x = 0$ all tangents are horizontal, which is to say their slopes are all zero. This implies that the slope of the tangents depends solely on the $x$-coordinate of the point and is independent of the $y$-coordinate. Also note that when $x > 0$ slopes are negative, and when $x < 0$ slopes are positive. Thus, the only differential equation that satisfies these conditions is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x$.\n",

The easiest way to determine where v and a have opposite signs is to graph their equations on your calculator. You're only interested in the interval from 0 to 10, so adjust your window accordingly. The graph should look like this:  https://img.apstudy.net/ap/calculus-bc/kp21/chapter23_pt1_q83_a_e.png  Examine the graph to find that the velocity and acceleration have opposite signs (one is above the x-axis while the other is below) on the intervals 0 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 t \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 2 and 4 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 t \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 6, which is (C).

When IMFs cause gas molecules to attract each other, that means they will hit the sides of the container less often and decrease the pressure. In this case, $H_2O$ has the strongest IMFs due to hydrogen bonding, and thus $H_2O$ molecules are most likely to deviate from ideal behavior.",

Beech seeds have a very long period of dormancy prior to germination.\nB. It takes an average of 75 years for conifer trees to become extinct.\nC. Agriculture was the predominant industry, and hardwood trees were removed.\nD. Maple trees grow better in a pine forest than they do in a grassland.\n",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "D Few species can grow in barren areas, but once they are colonized with plants, then more species can grow and live there. It takes a long time for the beech and maple trees to grow because first species need to change the environment, allowing other species to colonize. The environment was not hospitable until it was a pine forest, which took a long time to reach as well.",

Before collision, the only marble momentum was directed to the right. After the collision, the combined momentum of the two visible marbles is still to the right.

Choice A is wrong because momentum conservation does not require a leftward momentum component-since the initial momentum was all to the right, the final momentum should be to the right.

The elasticity of a collision refers to kinetic energy conservation, not momentum conservation-even inelastic collisions must conserve momentum. If the track is slanted downhill to the right, then the carts speed up; conservation of momentum won't be valid between Photogates 1 and 2 because the downhill component of the gravitational force is a force external to the two-cart system.",

            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "C: The work done by the spring is the area under a force-distance graph because work = force times distance. Using the best-fit line drawn as the top of a triangle, the area is (1/2) \u00d7 (300 N)(20 cm) = 3,000 N.cm.* Now, put your ruler along the data points.

In state 2, the charges are both bigger than in state 1, giving a bigger electrostatic force in state 2. Without even doing the calculation, you can recognize that since Newton's gravitational constant G is orders of magnitude less than the coulomb's law constant k, the electrostatic force will be much greater than the gravitational force between two objects in virtually any laboratory situation.

Subsequently, the block is stretched an additional 0.10 m and released such that it undergoes simple harmonic motion. What is the maximum kinetic energy of the block in its harmonic motion?\n\nA. 0.50 J\nB. 0.02 J\nC. 0.72 J\nD. 0.20 J",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "B: You can look at this two ways. The hard way is to consider the spring energy gained and the gravitational energy lost in stretching the spring the additional 0.10 m separately. The block-earth system loses $mgh = (0.20 kg)(10 N/kg)(0.10 m) = 0.20 J$ of gravitational energy; but the block-spring system gains $0.5kx_2^2 \u2013 0.5kx_1^2 = {0.5(4 N/m)(0.60 m)^2 \u2013 0.5(4 N/m)(0.50 m)^2} = 0.22 J$ of spring energy. Thus, the net work done on the block in pulling it the additional 0.10 m is 0.02 J. That's what is converted into the block's maximum kinetic energy. You can also look at it the easy way. With a vertical spring, consider the block-earth-spring system as a whole. Define the hanging equilibrium as the zero of the whole system's potential energy; then the potential energy of the whole system can be written as $0.5kx^2$, where x is the distance from this hanging equilibrium position. That's $0.5(4 N/m)(0.10 m)^2 = 0.02 J$.",

Furthermore, when a spring is at maximum compression or extension, all of its energy is potential energy, which is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. In adding this block, none of the relevant values are changed, so the spring will still extend to the same length, which means the amplitude is unchanged. Finally, maximum speed will be limited by the maximum K of the system (which will be unchanged since the maximum U was unchanged). $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, so the increased mass would have to be balanced by a decrease in speed to leave the K unaltered.\nIf you want a physical, rather than mathematical, explanation, think about the acceleration of the pair of blocks. The spring exerts the same force as before, but we effectively raised the block's mass. Thus, the acceleration is less than before. Since the distance from the starting point (maximum compression) to equilibrium is unchanged, the blocks will pick up less speed than the single block did before. Thus, maximum speed decreases.",

            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "C: The net torque on the rod must be zero, because the rod doesn't rotate. Therefore, whatever happens to Bob's torque must also happen to Tom's torque-these torques must cancel each other out. That eliminates choices A and B. The forces provided by Bob and Tom must add up to 500 N, the weight of the rod. Try doing two quick calculations: In the original case, Bob and Tom must each bear 250 N of weight and are each 2 m from the midpoint, for 500 N\u00b7m of torque each. Now put Tom farther from the midpoint-say, 3 m away. For the torques to balance, Fbob(2 m) = Ftom(3 m). The only way to satisfy this equation and get both forces to add up to 500 N is to use 300 N for Fbob and 200 N for Ftom. Now, the torque provided by each is (300 N)(2 m) = 600 N\u00b7m. ",

            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "A: There's no indication that energy must be conserved in collision 1. However, momentum is always conserved in a collision. When block A bounces, its momentum has to change to zero and then change even more to go back the other way. Since block A changes momentum by more in collision I, block B must as well because conservation means that any momentum change by block A must be picked up by block B. Choices C and D are wrong because, among other things, they use conservation of momentum to draw conclusions about two separate collisions; momentum conservation means that total momentum remains the same before and after a single collision, not in all possible collisions.",

Assume the hanging mass is heavy enough to make the resting block move. Knowing the acceleration of the system and the mass of each block is sufficient to calculate all of the following quantities EXCEPT which one? \n \n\n A. Net force on each block \n B. Tension in the string \n C. Coefficient of kinetic friction between the table and the block of mass M \n D. The speed of the block of mass M when it reaches the edge of the table",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "D: The net force on each block can be found by using Newton's Second Law, \\( F_{\\text{Net}} = ma \\). The tension in the string can be found by focusing on the hanging mass. You know the net force on it will be \\( F_{\\text{Net}} = ma = F_g - T = (mg) - T \\), which means \\( T = (mg) - (ma) \\). Finally, the coefficient of kinetic friction can be found by looking at the top block. For that block, the net force in the horizontal direction will be the same as the overall net force since the two vertical forces (normal and gravity) will cancel out. Thus, you get \\( F_{\\text{Net}} = ma = T - F_f = T - \\mu F_N = T - \\mu mg \\). The only value in the answers you cannot calculate is the speed of the block when it reaches the edge. In order to compute this value, you would need to know how far from the edge the block is when it begins moving.\n",

Looking first at the forces perpendicular to the plane, you get \\( F_N = F_g \\cos\\theta = mg\\cos\\theta \\).

The box does not move above or into the plane, so the forces in the y direction must be balanced.

Blocks B, C, and D are each released from rest, and block A is initially moving horizontally with a speed v. The mass of blocks A and C is 1 kg and the mass of blocks B and D is 2 kg. Assuming air drag and surface friction are negligible, rank the time it takes each block to reach the ground.\nA. tA = tC < tB = tD\nB. tA < tB < tC < tD\nC. tA = tB = tC = tD\nD. tA = tB < tC < tD\n",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "(D) Blocks A and B are both free falling, and free-fall acceleration is independent of mass; therefore, they will hit the ground at the same time. The mass of blocks C and D will not affect their acceleration for the same reason that mass does not affect free-fall acceleration: the mass cancels out of the ratio of net force to mass in Newton's second law. Blocks C and D only have a component of gravitational force accelerating them along the incline, so they have less net force acting on them compared to blocks A and B and they must travel along the whole length of the incline, as compared with the direct path of block B. Thus blocks C and D will take more time to reach the ground. Because block C has a greater component of gravitational force than D and a shorter path to travel, its time of travel will be less than D.",

The magnetic field from the bar magnet will always point toward a viewer who is looking down at the loop from above. As the north pole gets closer to the loop, the field at the loop grows in strength, but as the south pole recedes from the loop, the magnetic field strength shrinks.

            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "D The strength of the magnetic field at a distance r from a long, straight wire carrying a current I is given by the equation B = (\u00ce\u00bc0/2\u00cf\u0080)(I/r). Therefore, the strength of the magnetic field at Point P due to either wire is B = (\u00ce\u00bc0/2\u00cf\u0080)(I/ https://img.apstudy.net/ap/physics-2/br20/1by2.jpg d). By the right-hand rule, the direction of the magnetic field at P due to the top wire is into the plane of the page and the direction of the magnetic field at P due to the bottom wire is out of the plane of the page. Since the two magnetic field vectors at P have the same magnitude and opposite directions, the net magnetic field at Point P is zero.",

V is unchanged, but q is now positive and B is rotated 180\u00c2\u00b0 to point into the fourth quadrant.\n",
            "Answer (final answer highlighted)": "B All of the new experimental set-ups have the same magnitude of force as the original. In order to have the new experiment result in the same magnitude of the force, FB = |q||v||B| sin(\u00ce\u00b8) must be unchanged. Changing the signs of q, v, or B do not change the strength of the force. Rotating v and B by the same amount leaves \u00ce\u00b8 unchanged, and rotating B by 180\u00c2\u00b0 results in the same value for sin(\u00ce\u00b8). Thus, the invalid experiment must have a different direction of the magnetic force. Using the right-hand rule, rotating your thumb and fingers by 90\u00c2\u00b0 into the plane of the paper causes the magnetic force to rotate from the original direction of into the plane (recalling q is negative) to finally point to the right.",
